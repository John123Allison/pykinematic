# PyKinematic

Work in progress kinematics simulator using Pygame. 

Object code references an assets folder that I did not include in the repository, so if you choose to try this out, please create a folder in the project root called `assets` and add the assets as referenced by the code. **I'll probably move to vectors eventually, but for now this is the most convienent route.**

### Planned Features
- GUI to spawn and control objects
- Equation visualizer
